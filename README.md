# City Street Semantic Segmentation

Real-time semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.
Ideation and implementation of a different approachs.

## Team Approaches

| Member | Approach | Best Val mIoU |
|---|---|---|
| Ignia | Modified DeepLabV3+ wth MobileNetV2 + FEM attention | 50.49% (baseline) |
| Varun | HRNetV2-W48 + OCR | 68.7% |
| Subrajith | TBD | - |
| Raghunandan | TBD | - |

## Repo Structure

## Dataset
We use the [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) for all experiments.

### Download

2. Download these two files:
   - `gtFine_trainvaltest.zip` (241MB) — annotations
   - `leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip` (11GB) — images
3. Place and extract both under `data/cityscapes/` at the repo root
